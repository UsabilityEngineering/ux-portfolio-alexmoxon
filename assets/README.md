# Phase II: User-Centered Design

## Executive Summary: 
This design is what we created, inspired by the common issues that most of our interviewees dealt with wile growing their plants. 

Accompany the wireframes with justifications for how they have been motivated by the user research data, personas, and scenarios.

## Wireframes:

| Login | Create | Home Page
| Here is where the user can login or create an account with us to allow us to keep track of their previous scans. | This is where the user will be taken if they have not used this app before, and need to create an account. | The user can select what feature to use from the app at this point. They can perform an analysis of a plant by scanning it for issues, check their previous scans, or they can find a quick lookup on common illnesses that a plant may get.

| Plant Scan | Plant Scan Confirmation | Plant Scan Results
| This is the heart of the program, and is inspired due to our interviewees mentioning they wish they weould quickly be able to check with the internet what the problem is, without knowing any names initially. | This is where the user can take a picture of the plant they want to diagnose. We will use the phone's camera to scan the image, and use advanced algorithms to detect any patterns that resemble an illness of the plant. | This was recommended to be added during class critique, just in case the user made mistakes while taking a picture of their plant. This is where the user can confirm if this picture is how they would like it. They can rotate it or they can confirm it. | Here is where the results of the plant scan. This will describe the illness that the plant may have, what can cause the issue, and some remedies for the plant.

| Previous Scans | Previous Scan Selection | Common Illnesses
| Here is where we can see all the scans we have done before, just in case we need reference to them down the road. | This is what will show if we select an option from the previous scans menu. | This is inspired due to our interviewees all dealt with similar issues, and we thought we could aggregate this data here. Here is where we show common illnesses that the plant owners deal with commonly, in hopes that this can help a user quickly solve the issue from guides from here.

| Common Illnesses Selection | Profile / Settings
| Here is what we view if we select one of the options in the common illnesses menu. | Here is where the user can change their account information just in case if they need to provide more security and whatnot.
