# Paying at a register with your chipped ATM card during a Lunch break

### By Alex Moxon ~ 03/06/20

### Goals: 
Paying for my items in a **safe** & **efficient** matter.

**efficient** -> Minimal effort to place card into chip reader. No need for math, like when paying in cash. Don't need to waste time putting away change into wallet.

**safe** -> Currently the safest form of making a transaction. Reduces possibility of checker giving back the wrong amount in change.

### Description of Interaction:

1. Enter grocery store:

5. Checker scans items while asking if I have a rewards number with the store.
