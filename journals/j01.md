# Paying at a register with your chipped ATM card during a Lunch break

### By Alex Moxon ~ 03/06/20

### Goals: 
Learning how to **efficiently** & **safely** pay for items in the checkout line of a grocery store.

**efficient** -> Achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort while using a system or machine.

**safe** -> The use of computer software & security settings to illicit potential theft.

### Description of Interaction:

1. Enter grocery store, after ensuring you have the proper means of payment:

3. Assess the amount of people using self-checkout or regular-checkout lines & choose the option with the least amount of people.

### Outcome:
I was able to **efficiently** pay for my items at the grocery store, thanks to the beeping of the POS terminal telling me the transaction was completed. I've noticed that most customers don't pay much attention to the POS terminal & only realize the transaction has been completed thanks to the beeping sound it makes. I suggest that these terminals add a blinking aspect to the screen to help redirect customers back to the terminal. This would save a few seconds on each transaction. Multiply this by the amount of transactions they have a day & the store could save lots of time, that's typically wasted on customers not realizing the transaction has gone through. If they wanted to make it even more **efficent** & **safe** the POS terminal could pop-out the card after the transaction completes, redirecting the customers attention to the screen & their card. This would prevent customers from leaving their cards in the machine & speed up the overall process of paying for good in a store.
