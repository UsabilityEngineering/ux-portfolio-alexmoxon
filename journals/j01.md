# Paying at a register with your chipped ATM card during a Lunch break

### By Alex Moxon ~ 03/06/20

# Goals: Paying for my items **efficiently** & in a **safe** matter.

### **efficiently** -> Minimal effort to place card into chip reader. No need for math, like when paying in cash. Don't need to waste time putting away change into wallet.
### **safe** -> Currently the safest form of making a transaction. Reduces possibility of checker giving back the wrong amount in change.

# Description of Interaction:
### 1. Enter grocery store & head to the back for pre-made sandwiches:
