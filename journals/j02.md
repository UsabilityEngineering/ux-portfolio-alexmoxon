# Key FOB more like key POS

### By Alex Moxon ~ 04/19/21

### Goals: Learning how to **Effectively** use a key FOB at a new apartment complex.


**Effective** -> A system that is capable of allowing users to learn & access its primary functions quickly, while providing useful feedback.


### Description of Interaction:

1. Arrive at apartment complex.

2. Approach the primary entrance to the complex, notice black bar above the door handle.

3. Pull out your key FOB, make sure no other keys are around it or else the FOB will be **effectively** useless.

4. Hold key FOB directly onto the black bar above the handle for 3 seconds, until green or red light appears.

5. If green, open the door quickly or within three seconds the door will lock again. Now walk up the stairs to your apartment.

6. As you approach the room, pull out the FOB again but notice the lock design is different from the entrance.

7. Apply the same method as you did for the entrance lock & wait for the green light to appear.

8. Green light means go & are now able to turn the lock to your room. Make sure to turn it the proper way or you'll need to use the FOB again.

10. Enjoy finally being home

### Outcome:
I wasn't able to **effectively** use my key FOB for the first week of living at my new place. The locks don't provide any feedback on whether or not the key is being read by the reciever or that I'm even using it on the right spot. I've sat at the front entrance for minutes trying to get in, only to realize that another key was in the way or that I needed to hold it closer. The locks aren't **effective** in giving user feedback on failed attempts, while successful attempts take far to long to register. If possible, I suggest they use a key system similar to a new car key. Where the user just clicks a button & the door unlocks for a set period of time. Implementing this function would help a lot for people moving in or bringing loads of groceries from the car.
